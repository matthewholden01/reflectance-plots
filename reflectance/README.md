## Launching Bokeh Server

Once directories have been cloned, use anaconda to navigate to the directory containing the cloned files and launch the server using 
bokeh serve --show astro-lab which will automatically open a localhost:5006 window in your browser. In order to close the server either close
anaconda or exit the browser and press any button to close the server.
